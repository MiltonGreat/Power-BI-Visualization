# Interactive Power BI Dashboard Project

## Overview

This project involves the creation of an interactive and visually compelling Power BI dashboard that showcases key business trends, comparisons, and key performance indicators (KPIs). By leveraging Power BIâ€™s advanced features, I transformed raw data into actionable insights through a structured workflow.

The dashboard is designed to empower stakeholders with a comprehensive understanding of business metrics and enable data-driven decision-making.

## Project Workflow

The project followed a systematic approach, with the following steps:

1. Data Preparation with Power Query (03:34)
- Cleaned and transformed the dataset using Power Query.
- Removed inconsistencies, handled missing values, and optimized data for analysis.

2. Virtual Tables (06:08)
- Created virtual tables to streamline data relationships and improve analysis.
- Utilized calculated tables for custom aggregations and insights.

3. Data Model & Core Visuals (11:30)
- Designed a robust data model with relationships between tables.
- Built measures and calculated fields to derive key metrics.
- Added core visuals, including bar charts, line charts, and KPIs.

4. Formatting and Conditional Formatting (32:31)
- Enhanced visual aesthetics with formatting techniques.
- Applied conditional formatting to highlight important trends and outliers.

5. Advanced Visuals (42:12)
- Treemap: For hierarchical data analysis.
- Waterfall Chart: To visualize contributions to changes in metrics.
- Combo Chart: For dual-axis trend analysis.
- Scatter Chart with Zoom Slider: To explore detailed patterns in data.

6. Dynamic Titles and Formatting (52:57)
- Incorporated dynamic chart and axis titles based on user-selected filters.
- Applied consistent formatting for a professional appearance.

7. Dynamic Report Title (1:02:27)
- Added a dynamic report title that adjusts based on user interactions and slicers.

8. Final Tweaks, Review, and Publish (1:07:50)
- Reviewed the dashboard for consistency and usability.
- Published the dashboard for stakeholder access and feedback.
